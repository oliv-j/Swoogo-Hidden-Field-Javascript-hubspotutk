This script inserts the hubspotutk cookie value into a form field so that it can be collected as part of the contact information.

You can then use the hubspot integration settings in swoogo to map the field to hubspot.

1.In your swoogo account, make sure you gave enabled analytics.
2.In each event you will also need to enable the hubspot tracking code.
3.Add a text field to your swoogo account where you will collect the hubspotutk value (use a field name like hubspot_utk)
4.Add the field to an event.
5.View the field in web developer tools and find the ID of the field This might look like registrant-c_1234567
6.Add CSS to your theme template to hide the field, using the correct field ID e.g.

/* This is used to hide the hubspot_utk field from view */
.form-group.highlight-addon.field-registrant-c_1234567 {
display: none;
}

7. Update the ID of the form field in the javascript that you need to add the cooke value (see comment in code.
8. Create a javascript snippet from the main menu in swoogo account. Name it the same as your field name for ease e.g. hubspot_utk
9. In your event settings go to website settings and to the settings for the page where the field is displayed. 
10. Edit the settings. Go to the advanced settings at the bottom. Check the box for the javascript snippet you created earlier and save.
